“C. B. Black’s Guide-books have a character of their own; and that
character is a good one. Their author has made himself personally
acquainted with the localities with which he deals in a manner in which
only a man of leisure, a lover of travel, and an intelligent observer of
Continental life could afford to do. He does not ‘get up’ the places as
a mere hack guide-book writer is often, by the necessity of the case,
compelled to do. Hence he is able to correct common mistakes, and to
supply information on minute points of much interest apt to be
overlooked by the hurried observer.”</p>

contains an area of 3376 square miles; divided into 5 arrondissements,
subdivided into 62 cantons, and these again into 363 communes, with a
population of 275,000. The surface, of which little more than a tenth is
under cultivation, is composed of lofty and rugged granite mountain
chains, diverging in all directions from the culminating peaks of Mounts
<a name = "mt_cinto1" id = "mt_cinto1">Cinto</a>, 8892 ft.; <a name =

island these ranges terminate abruptly on the shore, or run out into the
sea; while, on the eastern side, a great undulating plain intervenes
between their termination and the coast, in summer troubled with
malaria, but in a less degree than formerly.</p>

<p>Corsica is the central region of the great plant system of the
Mediterranean. Among the many fine forests which cover the mountains,
the most important are those of Valdoniello, Filosorma, Vizzavona Verde,
Zonza, Bavella, Ometa and Calenzana. They contain noble specimens of
pines, oaks, beech, chestnut, walnut and olive trees. The cork oak forms
woods, chiefly in the south of the island. The <a name = "chestnut1" id
= "chestnut1">chestnut trees</a> are as large and fruitful as the best
on the Apennines, and the nuts form the staple article of food for man
and beast during the winter months. Indeed, these glorious chestnut and
beech forests, when in full foliage, are the grand features of Corsican
scenery, which therefore cannot be seen to advantage till towards the
end of May, and if to this we add the splendid bloom of the oleanders,
not till July. “I at any rate know of no such combination of sea and
mountains, of the sylvan beauty of the north with the rich colours of
the south; no region where within so small a space nature takes so many
sublime and exquisite aspects as she does in Corsica. Palms, orange
groves, olives, vines, maize and chestnuts; the most picturesque beech
forests, the noblest pine woods in Europe; granite peaks, snows and
frozen lakes&mdash;all these are brought into the compass of a day’s
journey. Everything is as novel to the Alpine climber as if, in place of
being on a fragment of the Alps, severed only by 100 miles from their
nearest snows, he was in a different continent.”&mdash;D.&nbsp;W.

<p>The prickly pear, the American aloe, the castor-oil plant and the
fig-tree, grow wild along the coast; while a little farther upwards, on
the slopes and plateaus, the arbutus, cistus, oleander, myrtle and
various kinds of heaths, form a dense coppice, called in the island
maqui, supplying an excellent covert for various kinds of game and
numerous blackbirds. When the arbutus and myrtle berries are ripe the
blackbirds are eagerly hunted, as at that time they are plump and make
very savoury and delicate eating.</p>

up to an elevation of 2000 ft. and the chestnut to 3000, where it gives
place to oaks, box trees, junipers, firs and beeches. The greater part
of the population inhabits the region of the chestnut trees, in villages

<p>AJACCIO, pop. 19,050, the capital of Corsica, is situated on the
extremity of a small gulf 677 miles from Paris and 15 to 20 hours’ sail
from Marseilles. Founded in 1492 by the Bank of St. George of Genoa, a
commercial association similar to the East India Company, it was raised
in 1811 through the influence of Madame Letitia and Cardinal Fesch to
the dignity of capital of the island, and became accordingly the
residence of the Préfet and the seat of the civil and ecclesiastical
Courts. Ajaccio has a handsome <a name = "ajaccio_episcopal" id =

<p>The mole at which passengers land from the steamers is at the foot of
the Place du Marché. In the centre of this “Place” is a fountain
ornamented with lions and a white marble statue of Napoleon I. by
Laboureur. To the left of the statue is the Hotel de Ville, the markets,
and the commencement of the Rue Fesch, in which is the edifice
containing the public library, the museum, and the memorial chapel (<a
href = "#ajaccio_memorial">p.&nbsp;5</a>); while to the right is the Rue
Napoleon, in which the first opening right leads into the Place Letitia.
A little beyond this opening is No. 17, the house of the <a name =
"ajaccio_pozzo" id = "ajaccio_pozzo">Pozzo di Borgo</a> family, of whom
Charles André, 1768-1842, was the great upholder of Paoli and the bitter
enemy of Napoleon I. Napoleon’s house, though not equal to that of the
Borgo family, was one of the best in Ajaccio. It is well built, of three
stories of six windows each, and all the rooms have a more or less
handsome marble chimney-piece. Over the door is inscribed on white
marble “Napoleon est né dans cette maison le <span class =
"smallroman">XV</span> Aovt <span class =
"smallroman">MDCCLXIX</span><ins class = "correction" title =

railing, leads to the top. The rooms shown are on the first floor. The
first is the parlour, with a small table, a few chairs, and a piano said
to have belonged to Mme. Letitia. Then after having passed through a
small chamber we enter the room in which Napoleon was born, into which
Madame was brought hurriedly from the church in the sedan chair kept in
the end room. Over the chimney-piece are portraits of the father and
mother. Then follows the dining-room, and after it the drawing-room,
with inlaid wood floor and six windows on both sides. The floors of all
the other rooms are of glazed tiles. In the next room is the sedan
chair. Fee for party 1&nbsp;fr.</p>

<p>This now silent and empty house was once enlivened and brightened by
the fair Letitia and her large family of children, just like other men’s
children; schoolboys toiling at their Plutarch or Cæsar, and their three
young sisters growing up careless and rather wild, like their
neighbours’ daughters, in the half-barbarous island town. There is
Joseph, the eldest, then Napoleon, the second born, then Lucien, Louis,
and Jerome; then Caroline, Eliza, and Pauline, the children of a notary
of moderate income, who is incessantly and vainly carrying on law-suits
with the Jesuits of Ajaccio to gain a contested estate which is
necessary to his numerous family. Their future fills him with anxiety;
what will they be in the world and how will they secure a comfortable
subsistence? And behold! these same children, one after the other, take
to themselves the mightiest crowns of the earth&mdash;tear them from the
heads of the most unapproachable kings of Europe and wear them in the
sight of

all the world; and they, the sons of an Ajaccio lawyer, cause themselves
to be embraced as brothers and brothers-in-law by emperors and kings.
Napoleon is European Emperor; Joseph King of Spain; Louis King of
Holland; Jerome King of Westphalia; Caroline Queen of Naples and Pauline
and Eliza Princesses of Italy. In 1793, after the flight of Madame
Letitia and her children to her country residence, the Casone, the house
was pillaged by the Corsicans opposed to the French Republic.</p>

the crypt under the transept, left hand, is the tomb of Marie Letitia
Ramolino, died at Rome in 1836; and right hand, that of Napoleon’s
uncle, Cardinal Fesch, died at Rome in 1839. Both bodies were brought to
this, their present resting-place, in 1851. There are, besides, the
tombs of Prince Charles and of Zenaida his daughter. Napoleon’s father
died in 1785 and is buried at Montpellier. Madame was only 35 at his
death and had already borne him 13 children, 5 of whom were dead, and
Jerome was an infant in the cradle.</p>

<p>Parallel with the Rue Fesch is the Cours Napoleon, by which all the
diligences enter and leave the town. The continuation round the bay is
bordered with plane trees. At the commencement is a bronze statue of
“E.&nbsp;C. Abbatucci né à Zicavo le 12 Novembre 1770, mort pour la
patrie le 2&nbsp;Decembre 1796.” Near it is the railway station.</p>

<p>At the western end of the Cours Napoleon is the Place Bonaparte or
Diamant, bordered with trees and ornamented with a complicate bronze
monument on a granite pedestal by Violet le Duc, “à la memoire de

are life-size statues; Napoleon is on horseback, the others on foot,

precipitous and jagged rocks rising from the Tavignano, commanding from
the top a magnificent view of the wild surrounding scenery. In the
“Place” is a statue of Paoli, the Corsican patriot, born at Stretta in
1726, and to the right of the statue the post and telegraph office. In
the immediate neighbourhood stands a large house, a Franciscan convent,

work commences. Block lies above block, towering upwards and upwards in
such endless masses of monotonous gray that the heart quails with the
sight and the foot trembles to go farther. After about 2 hours’ scramble
over these colossal steps the traveller reaches the fontaine de

little dark lake, the Lago di Monte Rotondo, encircled by gentle green
slopes, where the night is generally spent. Snow-field extend from the
lake to the summit, which, although apparently near, requires 2 full

“The view from Monte Rotondo did not impress me. The central uplands,
which form a large portion of it, are bare and arid, while the great
ridge of Monte Cinto stretches across the northern horizon like a long
screen. Comparatively little of the coast is seen in any direction, but
most towards the west. It was curious to notice how completely the tops
of the mountains between us and the Cinto ridge were flattened down,
while the crest on which we stood was a set of bristling teeth. There
are two kinds of granite in Corsica, one friable and unable to resist
the action of the air, the other hard and defiant of the elements. Of
this latter consist the Cinto range, Monte Rotondo and the rocks in the
forest of Bavella.”&mdash;D.&nbsp;W. Freshfield, Alpine Club.</p>

<p><i>Bastia</i>, the most important city of Corsica, is built on ground
rising gently from the sea. Facing the sea and the principal harbour is
the Place St. Nicholas, adorned with a marble statue of Napoleon I., by
Bartolini, looking towards the island of Elba. In this “Place”, the
promenade of the town, are the offices of the Messageries Maritimes and
of the Compagnie Insulaire. Fraissinet’s office is at the old harbour;
whence also their steamers sail.</p>

Boul. Cardo, one of the best roads to take for views of the town and
neighbourhood. A flight of steps leads from the quay up to the
cathedral, a handsome building in the Italian style. The markets are
held in the “Place” fronting the cathedral. Most of the houses are built
in large blocks from 5 to 6 stories high and from 6 to 9 windows broad,
each story forming a separate residence.</p>

<p>Bastia owes its name to the bastion built here by the Genoese in the

<p>The most beautiful part of Corsica, and the most easily visited, is
the eastern side, including the Castagniccia or the chestnut country,
and the whole region up in the mountains, which border this coast. The
wealthiest, most industrious and most enterprising of the people are
those who inhabit that long narrow tongue of land called Cap Corse.
Although boats are constantly sailing from Marseilles and Leghorn to
Bastia, invalids visiting Corsica with the intention of wintering in
Ajaccio should, if possible, sail from Marseilles or Nice direct to
Ajaccio; but on leaving the island, when winter is over, Bastia is
perhaps the best port to sail from, as it affords an excellent
opportunity for visiting the most beautiful parts of Corsica and the
most important towns in Italy. On arriving at Leghorn (see Black’s
<i>South France</i>) it is best to proceed at once to the railway
station, and start for Pisa, only 30 minutes distant. There are numerous
trains. At the station and in the kiosques in the “Piazzas” of Leghorn,
is sold an excellent little book with all the railway Time-tables,

crest towards the western coast and the valleys towards the eastern.
Hence the western Cornice road is a terrace along an always steep,
sometimes sheer, mountain side, while the eastern crosses a succession
of low maquis-covered spurs, which beyond Cap Sagro flatten and become
monotonous. Pino is one of the most beautiful sites on the western

to it, by a forsaken Franciscan convent. The view is grand. To this

used as a place of banishment for political offenders.</p>

<span class = "headnote">Seneca.</span></p>

<p>Lucius Annæus Seneca was born at Cordova in Spain, just before the
commencement of the Christian era. His eldest brother was A. Seneca
Novatus, which name was altered afterwards to that of his adopted
father, Junius Gallio. This brother was the proconsul of Achaia, before
whom St. Paul was arraigned (Acts xviii. 12). While Seneca was still a
child he was brought by his aunt to Rome, where he had for teachers
Sotion, Papirius Fabianus and Attalus the Stoic. Although weak in body
he was a most diligent student, which, joined to his powerful memory,
enabled him to obtain at an early age important offices. Before his
banishment, <span class = "smallroman">A.D.</span>&nbsp;41, he had
already served as quæstor. Having irritated Caligula, he would have been
put to death, had not one of the mistresses of the emperor assured him
that it was not worth while, as Seneca was so consumptive he would soon
die a natural death.</p>

<p>In the first year of the reign of Claudius, his wife Messalina having
become jealous of the influence his niece Julia, daughter of Germanicus,
had over Claudius her husband, succeeded in getting rid of her by
imputing to her improper intimacy with Seneca, then a married man. For
that reason Seneca was banished to Corsica <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>&nbsp;41.</p>

<p>During his exile he wrote his consolatory letter to his mother
Helvia, as well as a panegyric on Messalina and a consolatory letter to
Polybius, ostensibly to condole with him on the loss of his brother; but
in reality to get that powerful freedman to exert his influence with the
emperor, to recall his sentence of exile. This letter is full of fulsome
flattery and expressions unworthy of an honest man.</p>

<p>After the death of Messalina, Claudius married his niece Agrippina,
sister of Julia and mother of Nero by a former husband. Through her
influence Seneca was recalled <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>&nbsp;49 and appointed a prætor and tutor to
Nero, then 11 years old. In <span class =

exquisite variety and charm of the drive, especially after quitting the

wander far from the main purpose of this paper. Valery, Gregorovius,
Lear and others have done justice to its wonderful beauty, and the last
truly remarks that ‘those who visit Corsica without going through upper
Balagne remain ignorant of one of its finest divisions,’ adding, ‘no
description can exaggerate the beauty of this remarkable tract of
mountain background and deep valley, which for richness of foreground,
cheerful fertility and elegance of distance may compete with most
Italian landscapes.’ The district is densely peopled&mdash;at least
twelve large villages are situated on the road itself between Belgodere

lofty campanili perch high up on the mountain slopes or crown the

BONIFACIO pop. 4000. H.&nbsp;du Nord; France in the high town.
Diligences leave daily for Bastia, Sartène, and Ajaccio. A steamer
arrives every Saturday from Ajaccio and returns on the Monday. Bonifacio
was founded in 833 by the Tuscan marquis whose name it bears, to protect
this part of the island against the piratical incursions of the
Saracens. The high town is built on the top of a limestone rock rising
vertically from the sea. The low town occupies one side of the fine
natural dock, hemmed in by perpendicular cliffs with an opening of only
328 yards towards the sea. From the steamboat wharf a broad paved series
of steps leads up to the high town, entering it through the Porte
Vieille. In the old house fronting this Porte or gateway, <a name =
"bonifacio_charles" id = "bonifacio_charles">Charles V.</a>, in 1541,
stayed two days and a night on his return from his unsuccessful
expedition against Algiers. Overtaken by a storm, he had taken refuge in
the Gulf of Santa Manza. The door of the house, decorated with an
arabesque on marble, is in the narrow side street. In the Place d’Armes
are the church of San Domenico, built by the Templars, characterised by
its octagonal tower with an embrasured termination; and the great tower
“Torrione,” part of the fortifications built by the marquis, and
formerly the most important part of the citadel. Near this tower is the
flight of steps “Redragon,” cut in the rock by the Genoese, which
descends by 202 steps to the sea. The small room over the gateway of the
citadel, opposite the house of Charles V., was inhabited by <a name =
"bonifacio_napoleon" id = "bonifacio_napoleon">Napoleon</a> for nearly
eight months. There are grand sea-views from the ramparts. The town
consists of tall, dingy houses, and narrow, steep, and in most cases
dirty streets. The promenade of Bonifacio is the small covered terrace
before the church of Santa Maria. Here also is the public cistern.</p>

Place d’Armes, and extends to an unknown distance. It contains a
freshwater lake, which rises and falls with the tide. A staircase with a
vaulted roof and consisting of 337 steps leads down to this lake. The
water is brought up to the surface by a force pump, is perfectly
transparent, with a slight calcareous taste. In the high town there are
39 private and one public cistern, in which the rain water from the
roofs is stored up. The low town has a well supplied from a stream by an
aqueduct. The afternoon is the best time to visit the caves. A boat for
one or party should not cost more than 5&nbsp;frs. The finest, the
Dragonetta, cannot be visited when the sea is rough.</p>

ALERIA. Inn. The capital of Corsica till the invasion of the Saracens in

the mouth of the Tavignano, 1¼&nbsp;m. from the Etang de Diane. Ancient
Aleria, the colony founded by the dictator Sulla about 82 <span class =

waters one of the finest plains in the world, where winter is unknown.
The site of the town was well selected. The population was probably

mural tablet against the exterior wall, west end, is the following
epitaph written by Horace Walpole:&mdash;“Near this place is interred
Theodore, King of Corsica, who died in this parish, Dec. 11, 1756,
immediately after leaving the King’s Bench prison, by the benefit of the
Act of Insolvency. In consequence of which, he registered his kingdom of

SKETCH OF THE HISTORY OF CORSICA.</a></h4>

<p>It is not known who the original inhabitants of Corsica were. The
Phocæans of Ionia were the first civilised people that established
settlements in Corsica. About the year 560 <span class =
"smallroman">B.C.</span> they landed on the island, and founded at the
mouth of the Tavignano the city of Aleria, which after a short
occupation they were compelled to abandon. After an interval of a few
years they again returned, rebuilt Aleria, which they fortified, and
endeavoured to maintain their ground against the natives. After a
struggle of some years they were again compelled to leave the island.
The next foreign occupants of Corsica were the Tuscans, who founded the
city of Nicæa, but they in their turn were compelled to give way before
the growing maritime power of the Carthaginians, whose jurisdiction in
the island was unquestioned till the beginning of the first Punic War.
On that occasion the Romans sent out a fleet, drove the Carthaginians
from the island, and exacted
<span class = "pagenum">38</span>
<a name = "page38" id = "page38"> </a>
<!--png 058-->
at least a nominal homage from the native population. They did not,
however, fully establish their power here till about thirty years later,
and even then rebellions and revolts were of constant occurrence.</p>

<p class = "headnote">
<span class = "headnote">Roman Colonies.</span></p>

<p>The first step made towards the real subjugation of the island was
the establishment of the two colonies on its eastern coast-that of
Aleria by Sulla and that of Mariana by Marius. In the time of the
emperors the island had fallen into disrepute among the Romans, by whom
it was used chiefly as a place of banishment for political offenders.
One of the most distinguished of these sufferers was the younger Seneca,
who spent in this island eight years of banishment ending with 49 <span

<p>On the downfall of the Roman empire in the West, Corsica passed into
the hands of the Vandals. These barbarians were driven out by
Belisarius, but after his death, 565 <span class =
"smallroman">A.D.</span>, the resistless hordes of Attila once more
gained possession of the island. Since that period it has successively
owned the dominion of the Goths, the Saracens, the Pisans and the
Genoese. The impress of the last is to be found in the style of the
church architecture, while the armorial crest of the island, a&nbsp;<a

<p class = "headnote"><a name = "sampiero38" id = "sampiero38">
<span class = "headnote">Sampiero.</span></a></p>

<p>Among the most renowned and intrepid patriots in the struggle of the
Corsicans to free themselves from the Genoese was Sampiero, born of poor
parents towards the end of the 15th cent, in Dominicacci, one of the
hamlets which compose Bastelica. His house having been burned down by
the Genoese, the inhabitants in the 18th cent. constructed a new one on
the same site, on which Mr. Wyse, an Irishman, affixed a tablet with an
inscription in 1855, expressing his admiration of the man. After serving
with great distinction in the armies of the Italian princes and in those
of Francis I., King of France, Sampiero returned to Corsica in 1547 and
married the fair <a name = "vanina38" id = "vanina38">Vanina</a>,
heiress of Ornano, belonging to one of the oldest families in the
island.</p>

<p>Shortly after the marriage the Corsicans, led by Sampiero, revolted
against the tyranny of the Banking Company of St. George of Genoa, and,
assisted by the French, under General Thermes, overthrew them after six
years of hard fighting and much bloodshed, in which Sampiero and his
peasant army bore by far the greatest share. All, however, they had
gained at such immense sacrifice was completely lost to them by the
treaty of Chateau Cambresis, 1559, by which France agreed
<span class = "pagenum">39</span>
<a name = "page39" id = "page39"> </a>
<!--png 059-->
to restore Corsica to Genoa. Sampiero and his family had to leave the
island. Such was the virulent and implacable hatred Sampiero bore to the
Genoese, that he with his own hand, in cold blood, strangled mercilessly
his trembling wife three years after (1562) in Marseilles, for having
allowed herself, in his absence, to be persuaded to make an arrangement
with the Genoese to save the patrimony of her children. Sampiero escaped
with impunity, although he buried his murdered wife publicly, and with
pomp, in the church of St. Francis at Marseilles.</p>

<p>Antonio Francesco, the younger son, who was, when a mere child, with
his mother when she was murdered, was afterwards assassinated at Rome by
a Frenchman, whom he had insulted while playing at cards.</p>

<p>On the 12th June 1564 Sampiero landed at the Gulf of Valinco with a
band of 20 Corsicans and 25 Frenchmen, to make another desperate attempt
to free Corsica from the hated yoke. After a five years’ life-and-death
struggle, fired by a feverish thirst for revenge, the Corsicans had to
yield to the might of Genoa, supported by well-drilled Italian, German
and Spanish mercenaries, commanded by their greatest generals, Doria,
Centurione and Spinola, and aided by a powerful fleet.</p>

<p>On the 17th January 1567 Sampiero was slain in an ambuscade laid for
him in the defile of Cauro, into which he had been led by forged letters
brought him by the monk Ambrosius of Bastelica.</p>

<p>His elder son Alfonso d’Ornano continued the struggle after his
father’s death, till the exhausted state of Corsica compelled him to
desist and to accept a general amnesty proclaimed by the Genoese
governor George Doria in 1569. Alfonso d’Ornano was afterwards created
“Maréchal de France.”</p>

<p>From 1755 the <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘Corscians’">Corsicans</ins>, led by the brave Pascal Paoli,
carried on the struggle for their independence against the Genoese, who
were occasionally assisted by the French. On the 15th May 1768 the
former sold their presumed claims to the island to the French, who ended
this war of subjugation by the terrible battle of <a name =

llth of June Paoli left Porto-Vecchio for London; where, at the instance
of the Duke of Grafton, then prime minister of England, he received an
annual pension of £1200.</p>

<p>After Corsica had been made one of the departments of France he was
invited in 1790, by the National Assembly, to take the supreme command
in the island. On his arrival at Paris (3d&nbsp;April 1790), on his way
to Corsica, he was fêted as the Washington of Europe, and Lafayette was
constantly by his side; while, on his arrival at Marseilles, he was
received by a deputation, among whom was Napoleon. In July 1790 he
landed at <a name = "macinaggio39" id = "macinaggio39">Macinaggio</a>,

<!--png 060-->
The execution of the king and the cruelties and excesses of the
Convention having shocked the philanthropic spirit of Paoli and
alienated his sympathies, he organised a revolt to separate Corsica from
France, and succeeded by the aid of the English fleet, 20th July 1794,
when Calvi, the last of the forts, surrendered. On the 10th of June 1794
the Corsicans declared that they would unite their country to Great
Britain, but that it was to remain independent, and to be governed by a
viceroy according to their own constitution.</p>

<p>The English, from ignorance, managed the affairs of the island so
badly, that when in 1796 Napoleon sent troops against them, they were
joined by the Corsicans, who together forced the English to leave the
island. Not only had a certain Gilbert Elliot been named viceroy instead
of Paoli, but this same man having written to the Government that it was
necessary for the safety of the English to remove Paoli from the island,
George III. wrote Paoli a letter inviting him to return to England and
to his court. It is suspected that Andrea Pozzo di Borgo, president of
the Council of State, under the short viceroyship of Elliot, influenced,
for his own ends or from jealousy, the English in Corsica against
Paoli.</p>

<p>Paoli lived twelve years more in London, died peacefully on 5th
February 1807 at the age of 82, was buried in St. Pancras churchyard,
and a small monument to his memory was placed in Westminster Abbey. He
bequeathed to four professors of the intended Corté University salaries
of £50 a year each, but as it was never established the money was given
to the Ecole Paoli in Corté, attended by 120 pupils.</p>

<p>Since the expulsion of the English, the French have remained in
undisturbed possession of Corsica. The English occupation lasted from
1794 to 1796.</p>

<p>The Corsicans look to the Government for the improvement of their
island far more than to their own efforts, for they themselves are
neither industrious nor enterprising. The roads, railways, bridges and
other public works are constructed chiefly by Italian labourers. The
women do the drudgery both in their homes and on the fields, carrying
great loads on their heads, as the mules do on their backs; but bestow
little labour on the cleanliness of their children and dwellings, and do
not make good domestic servants. In many small towns women are the bread
bakers and assistant butchers. The villages, excepting in Cape Corse,

exists in the villages; where the people having no social amusements,
nothing to read, nor any other resource than cards during the winter
nights, are apt to quarrel over trifles; which, fanned by their local
petty jealousies, assisted often by the generous nature of their wine,
ripen into deadly feuds.</p>

<p>The staple food of the majority of the inhabitants, as well as of the
horses and mules, during a great part of the year, is the <a name =
"chestnut41" id = "chestnut41">chestnut</a>. For domestic purposes it is
mostly ground, when it costs only about half the price of wheat flour,
which is procured chiefly from Marseilles, Corsica itself producing very
little. The ease with which the harvest of chestnuts is annually
obtained tends to foster indolence and deaden enterprise among the
peasantry. The one great danger to which the generous chestnut trees are
exposed is a conflagration. Besides olives, pines, beeches and
chestnuts, there are also important forests of <a name = "evergreen" id
= "evergreen">evergreen oaks</a>, the <a name = "quercus" id =
"quercus"><ins class = "correction" title =
"error for ‘Quercus ilex’">Quercus Ilex</ins></a>, called also the holm
oak. It has abundance of dark-green ovate leaves, mostly prickly at the
margin; the acorns are oblong on short stalks; the stem grows to the
height of 80 ft.; the wood is dark-brown and hard, weighing 70 lbs. the
cubic foot, while the same of the Quercus ruber or British oak weighs
only 55 lbs., and the tree attains a vast age. The cork oak, Quercus
suber, grows either singly among other trees or in groups, principally
in the southern parts of the island. The bark is of little commercial
importance.</p>

The inhabitants do not assist nature. Their seed potatoes are of an
inferior class, their fruit trees receive little attention, very few of
the vineyards are carefully cultivated, and their sheep, goats and pigs
are of poor breeds. Of late years many have taken to the growing of
lemons and citrons; which in a good year yield a very handsome profit;
but the harvest, through untimely frosts, is precarious. The
headquarters of this culture is Cape Corse. The olive trees yield a more
secure though less remunerative harvest. That terrible scourge the
phylloxera has got among the vineyards, where it is committing its usual
havoc.</p>

The drives and pedestrian excursions about Corsica are superb,
especially along the east side and up the centre by Sartène, Zicavo and
Ghisoni (<a href = "#sartene">p.&nbsp;27</a>), and the road between
Calvi and Ponte alla Leccia (<a href =
"#leccia_to_calvi">p.&nbsp;20</a>). There are inns in all the large
villages, though the only good and comfortable hotels are in
Ajaccio.</p>

Enterprising tourists wishing to explore the great forests and to scale
the mountains should endeavour to procure letters of introduction from
the chief forestal authorities at Ajaccio, Corté, Bastia or Calvi to the
occupants of the Maisons Forestières in the forests to be visited.
Although the gardes forestières are generally hospitable, they are
afraid to follow their inclination without orders from their superiors.
For each day in these houses 7&nbsp;to 8 frs. should be given.</p>

Transcriber’s Notes</h4>

<p>When the Index and body text disagreed on spelling, the form shown in
the <a href = "#map2">General Map</a> was used. The abbreviation “ft”
was regularized to “ft.” where the full stop was missing or
invisible.</p>

<p>
<a href = "#tagA" name = "noteA" id = "noteA">A*.</a>
Index entry reads “Calenzani”, but body text has “Calenzana”; it appears
to refer to the same place as the earlier Index entry for “Calenzana”.
</p>

<p>
<a href = "#tagBi" name = "noteB" id = "noteB">B*</a> (Index), <a href =
"#tagBt">B*</a> (text).
Body text has “Garanace” and Index has “Garance”. The Map’s spelling
“Granace” was used because it can be found in modern sources; the Index
entry was alphabetized accordingly.
</p>

<p>
<a href = "#tagC" name = "noteC" id = "noteC">C*</a>.
The General Map and the town description (<a href =
"#pontenovo">p.&nbsp;9</a>) use the “Novo” spelling; references on <a
href = "#pontenovo22">p.&nbsp;22</a> and <a href =
"#pontenovo39">p.&nbsp;39</a> use “Nuovo”. The Index as printed had
parallel entries: “Ponte Novo 9, 22” and “Ponte Nuovo 9, 22”. The
p.&nbsp;39 link was added by the transcriber.
</p>

<p>
<a href = "#tagD" name = "noteD" id = "noteD">D*</a>.
The names “Col St. Sebastien” and “Col Sebastien” are each used once in
the text. They are the same place, called “St. Sebastien” on the Map.

<h5 class = "boldf"><a name = "duplicate" id = "duplicate">About the
Guidebook</a></h5>

<p>The <i>Itinerary through Corsica</i> originally appeared as one
section of Black’s guide to the Riviera. In later editions it became a
separate volume. In the text as scanned, the Table of Contents and List
of Maps appear twice: first as pages v-vii (with Maps on unpaginated
viii) headed “Contents”, then as pages xv-xvii (Maps on xviii) headed
“Corsica”. Pages ix-xiv are absent. The simplest explanation is that the
introductory pages from two different versions of the book found their
way into the same archive.</p>

<p>Black’s <i>Guide to South France, East Half</i> says: “The asterisk
signifies that they [hotels or inns] are especially good of their
class.” As this explanation comes more than 200 pages into the book, it
can be assumed that the usage was already familiar to the reader.</p>

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
